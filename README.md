This section covers how to set up and manage the application locally using the provided `Makefile` commands.

### Setting Up Locally

The `Makefile` provides a set of commands to simplify the setup and management of the application. Below are the available commands and their usage:

#### Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the application, run:

```bash
make build
```

This command will:

- Stop any running containers.
- Remove volumes, images, and orphaned containers.
- Build the Docker image.

#### Start the Application

To start the application using Docker Compose, run:

```bash
make up
```

This command will start the application in detached mode.

#### Stop the Application

To stop the application without removing containers, run:

```bash
make stop
```

#### Remove Containers and Volumes

To stop the application and remove all containers, volumes, and images, run:

```bash
make down
```

#### Access the Container Shell

To access the shell of the running application container, run:

```bash
make shell
```

This command will open a bash shell inside the `admin-portal-app` container.

### Notes
